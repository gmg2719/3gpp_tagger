The UE initiates the TAU procedure by sending, to the eNodeB, a TAU Request (UE Core Network Capability, MS Network Capability, Preferred Network behaviour, Support for restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage, old GUTI, Old GUTI type, last visited TAI, active flag, signalling active flag, EPS bearer status, PTMSI Signature, additional GUTI, eKSI, NAS sequence number, NAS-MAC, KSI, Voice domain preference and UE's usage setting) message together with RRC parameters indicating the Selected Network and the old GUMMEI An exception is that, if the TAU was triggered for load re-balancing purposes (see clause 4.3.7.3), the old GUMMEI is not included in the RRC parameters. The UE shall set the Old GUTI Type to indicate whether the Old GUTI is a native GUTI or is mapped from a P-TMSI and RAI.

If the UE's TIN indicates "GUTI" or "RATrelated TMSI" and the UE holds a valid GUTI then the old GUTI indicates this valid GUTI. If the UE's TIN indicates "PTMSI" and the UE holds a valid PTMSI and related RAI then these two elements are indicated as the old GUTI. Mapping a PTMSI and RAI to a GUTI is specified in Annex H. When the UE is in connected mode (e.g. in URA_PCH) when it reselects to EUTRAN, the UE shall set its TIN to "PTMSI".

If the UE holds a valid GUTI and the old GUTI indicates a GUTI mapped from a P-TMSI and RAI, then the UE indicates the GUTI as additional GUTI. If the old GUTI indicates a GUTI mapped from a P-TMSI and RAI, and the UE has a valid P-TMSI signature, the P-TMSI signature shall be included.

The additional GUTI in the Tracking Area Update Request message allows the new MME to find any already existing UE context stored in the new MME when the old GUTI indicates a value mapped from a P-TMSI and RAI.

Alternatively, when a UE only supports E-UTRAN, it identifies itself with the old GUTI and sets the Old GUTI Type to 'native'.

The RRC parameter "old GUMMEI" takes its value from the identifier that is signalled as the old GUTI according to the rules above. For a combined MME/SGSN the eNodeB is configured to route the MMEcode(s) of this combined node to the same combined node. This eNodeB is also configured to route MMEcode(s) of GUTIs that are generated by the UE's mapping of the PTMSIs allocated by the combined node. Such an eNodeB configuration may also be used for separate nodes to avoid changing nodes in the pool caused by inter RAT mobility.

The last visited TAI shall be included in order to help the MME produce a good list of TAIs for any subsequent TAU Accept message. Selected Network indicates the network that is selected. Active flag is a request by UE to activate the radio and S1 bearers for all the active EPS Bearers by the TAU procedure when the UE is in ECM-IDLE state. Signalling active flag is a request by UE using Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation to maintain the NAS signalling connection after Tracking Area Update Procedure is completed in order to transmit pending Data using the Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation or NAS signalling. The EPS bearer status indicates each EPS bearer that is active in the UE. The TAU Request message shall be integrity protected by the NAS-MAC as described in TS 33.401 [41]. eKSI, NAS sequence number and NAS-MAC are included if the UE has valid EPS security parameters. NAS sequence number indicates the sequential number of the NAS message. KSI is included if the UE indicates a GUTI mapped from a PTMSI in the information element "old GUTI".

In the RRC connection establishment signalling associated with the TAU Request, the UE indicates its support of the CIoT EPS Optimisations relevant for MME selection.

For UE using CIoT EPS Optimisation without any activated PDN connection, there is no active flag or EPS bearer status included in the TAU Request message. For a UE with a running Service Gap timer in the UE the UE shall not set the active flag and the signalling active flag in the TAU request message (see clause 4.3.17.9).

If the UE has PDN connection of PDN Type "non-IP", UE shall indicate EPS bearer status included in the TAU Request message.

The UE sets the voice domain preference and UE's usage setting according to its configuration, as described in clause 4.3.5.9.

The UE includes extended idle mode DRX parameters information element if it needs to enable extended idle mode DRX, even if extended idle mode DRX parameters were already negotiated before.

If a UE includes a Preferred Network Behaviour, this defines the Network Behaviour the UE is expecting to be available in the network as defined in clause 4.3.5.10.
