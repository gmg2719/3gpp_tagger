NOTE?2:	This signalling of the Access Restriction during the TAU after the inter-RAT handover procedure means that there is a small risk that NR resources are transiently allocated.
The eNB, at which the S1-MME terminates, performs all necessary S1-MME related functions (as specified for any serving eNB) such as mobility management, relaying of NAS signalling, E-RAB handling, etc. and manages the handling of user plane connection of S1-U.
Additional functional characteristics are:
-	CSG function may be supported in case the Secondary eNB is a hybrid access eNB (see more details in clause?5.4.7 and in TS?36.300?[5]).
